# Csharp-Console-Application
this is a console app using .NET Core 2.0 with Visual Studio 2017

Aim

You own a chain of Magic Supply Stores supplying stock to Melbourne's best magicians and the public. You decide to create a Console Application using .NET Core 2.0 with Visual Studio 2017 (OLDER VERSIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED) & Microsoft SQL Server database for your business.

Scenario & Business Requirements

You have franchises in five locations around Melbourne. One in Melbourne CBD and 4 other locations in Melbourne servicing the North, East, South and West areas of Melbourne. Each store sells to both retail (the public) and wholesale to registered Magicians.

The system must accommodate three types of users: Owner (You), Franchise Owner (for each store), and Customers (Wholesale / Retail).

The Owner is responsible for supplying the Franchise Stores with stock when requested.

The Franchise Owner should be able to check their inventory and request stock replenishment. Each store can carry distinct products selected from the ownerâ€™s inventory.

Stock for both your main inventory and for the individual stores is stored in a SQL Server database. Some SQL scripts are provided for a recommended structure and data seeding; however, it is not mandatory to use the provided schema.

The Retail Customer can purchase products. There will be no prices involved when purchasing products in this assignment. The only way a purchase can fail is if the item being purchased has an insufficient stock level for the quantity requested.
